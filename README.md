# CDataframe - Dynamic Tabular Data Library in C
## Description

CDataframe is a specialized C library designed for managing and manipulating tabular data, drawing inspiration from the Python Pandas library. It allows users to create, modify, and analyze dataframes containing multiple columns of various types.

This project was developed for the Algorithmique et Structures de données 1 course at Efrei Paris.

## Features
The library provides an interactive menu system to perform the following operations:

## 1. Dataframe Management  

Creation: Initialize a new dataframe by specifying the number of columns and their respective types.

Flexible Filling: * Hardcoded initial data for testing.

Manual user input for custom datasets.

Persistence: Export your dataframe to a .csv file format.

## 2. Modification Tools

Columns: Rename existing columns, add new columns with specific types, or delete them by name.


Rows: Append new rows of data or delete specific rows by their index.


Cells: Directly access and replace values within specific cells using coordinates.

## 3. Display & Search
Visual Output:

Print the entire dataframe.

Print a selected interval of rows or columns.

List all column headers.


Search Functionality: Verify if a specific value exists within the dataframe across various data types.

## Supported Data Types
The library handles all primary C types:

INT: Signed integers.

UINT: Unsigned integers.

CHAR: Single characters.

FLOAT: Single-precision floating-point numbers.

DOUBLE: Double-precision floating-point numbers.

STRING: Character arrays (strings).

## Instructions :
You must run the program and let you guide by the intruction in the console
